# BOFHound

BOFHound is an offline BloodHound ingestor and LDAP result parser compatible with TrustedSec's [ldapsearch BOF](https://github.com/trustedsec/CS-Situational-Awareness-BOF) and the Python adaptation, [pyldapsearch](https://github.com/fortalice/pyldapsearch).

By parsing log files generated by the aforementioned tools, BOFHound allows operators to utilize BloodHound's beloved interface while maintaining full control over the LDAP queries being run and the spped at which they are executed. This leaves room for operator discretion to account for potential honeypot accounts, expensive LDAP query thresholds and other detection mechanisms designed with the traditional, automated BloodHound collectors in mind.

## Example Usage
Parse ldapseach BOF results from Cobalt Strike logs (`/opt/cobaltstrike/logs` by default) to /data/
```
bofhound -o /data/
```

Parse pyldapsearch logs and only include all properties (vs only common properties)
```
bofhound -i ~/.pyldapsearch/logs/ --all-properties
```

# ldapsearch

## Required Data
The following attributes are required for proper functionality:

```
samaccounttype
dn
objectsid
```

## Example ldapsearch Queries
Get All the Data (Maybe Run BloodHound Instead?)
```
ldapsearch (objectclass=*) *,ntsecuritydescriptor
```

Retrieve All Schema Info
```
ldapsearch (schemaIDGUID=*) name,schemaidguid -1 "" CN=Schema,CN=Configuration,DC=windomain,DC=local
```

Retrieve Only the ms-Mcs-AdmPwd schemaIDGUID
```
ldapsearch (name=ms-mcs-admpwd) name,schemaidguid 1 "" CN=Schema,CN=Configuration,DC=windomain,DC=local
```

# Development
