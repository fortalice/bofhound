# BOFHound

BOFHound is an offline BloodHound ingestor and LDAP result parser compatible with TrustedSec's [ldapsearch BOF](https://github.com/trustedsec/CS-Situational-Awareness-BOF) and the Python adaptation, [pyldapsearch](https://github.com/fortalice/pyldapsearch).

By parsing log files generated by the aforementioned tools, BOFHound allows operators to utilize BloodHound's beloved interface while maintaining full control over the LDAP queries being run and the spped at which they are executed. This leaves room for operator discretion to account for potential honeypot accounts, expensive LDAP query thresholds and other detection mechanisms designed with the traditional, automated BloodHound collectors in mind.

*Note - The ldapsearch BOF in the main TrustedSec repo currently has a limitation when querying the nTSecurityDescriptor attribute as a low privilege user. As a workaround to enumerate full ACL data as any user, you can compile the ldapsearch BOFs from the `feature/add-acl-collections` branch of this [fork](https://github.com/coffeegist/CS-Situational-Awareness-BOF/tree/feature/add-acl-collections) and copy them into your local copy of the main TrustedSec repo*

# Installation
BOFHound can be installed with `pip3 install bofhound` or by cloning this repository and running `pip3 install .`.

# Usage
![](.assets/usage.png)


## Example Usage
Parse ldapseach BOF results from Cobalt Strike logs (`/opt/cobaltstrike/logs` by default) to /data/
```
bofhound -o /data/
```

Parse pyldapsearch logs and only include all properties (vs only common properties)
```
bofhound -i ~/.pyldapsearch/logs/ --all-properties
```

# ldapsearch Query Examples

## Required Data
The following attributes are required for proper functionality:

```
samaccounttype
dn
objectsid
```

Get All the Data (Maybe Run BloodHound Instead?)
```
ldapsearch (objectclass=*)
```

Retrieve All Schema Info
```
ldapsearch (schemaIDGUID=*) name,schemaidguid -1 "" CN=Schema,CN=Configuration,DC=windomain,DC=local
```

Retrieve Only the ms-Mcs-AdmPwd schemaIDGUID
```
ldapsearch (name=ms-mcs-admpwd) name,schemaidguid 1 "" CN=Schema,CN=Configuration,DC=windomain,DC=local
```

# Development
bofhound uses Poetry to manage dependencies. Install from source and setup for development with:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/fortalice/bofhound
cd bofhound
poetry install
poetry run bofhound --help
```
